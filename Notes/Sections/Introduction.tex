\noindent Human capital investment and accumulation are essential components of any model that aims to study some of the most relevant topics in Economics. Three representative examples are the economic growth and development of nations, the gender and black-white wage gaps, or the rate of return to schooling. \citet{becker1962investment} is the main predecessor in the formal analysis of human capital. His work offers the first unified and comprehensive framework to study human capital investment with the usual tools of Economics.\footnote{\citet{becker2009human} collates the work of this author on the subject and summarizes his work on schooling, learning-by-doing, and on-the-job training.} \\
\indent Following this work, \citet{ben1967production} proposes a dynamic model that relates human capital accumulation to life-cycle earnings. Currently, this is the workhorse model when it comes to analyze the relation between human capital accumulation decisions and life-cycle outcomes. The vast majority of papers that model human capital use some variation of the so-called Ben-Porath model (\textbf{see Figure 1}). These variations lead to very different time profiles of investment in human capital, human capital accumulation, and earnings.\\
\indent In this paper, we analyze the Ben-Porath model and several of its variations in order to inform researchers on the consequences of their modeling decisions. We proceed as follows: in Section 1 presents the baseline specification. Section 2 specializes the model to a case with no depreciation and infinite horizon, in which many implications are easy to obtain in closed form and provide intuition and the possibility of straightforward graphical analysis. Section 3 analyzes what we call the Haley-Rosen specification, which enables for finite horizon but keeps tractability. Section 4 studies the model in its general formulation. Section 5 allows for depreciation and develops conditions under which investment in human capital happens in different episodes over the life-cycle. Section 6 offers some final comments. \\
